  measured in bushels. The following will help you in your decisions:
    * Each person needs at least 20 bushels of grain per year to survive.
    * Each person can farm at most 10 acres of land.

  Rule wisely and you will be showered with appreciation at the end of
  your term. Rule poorly and you will be kicked out of office!""")
